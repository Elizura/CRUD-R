# restful-django-crud-api
This is a sample RESTful CRUD API built using Python Django framework. The API allows you to create, read, update, and delete data from a database. The API is built following RESTful principles and supports HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
## Getting Started
    1 Install Docker on your machine.
    2 Clone this repository to your local machine.
    3 Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
    4 Build the Docker image by running docker build -t my-api . (don't forget the period at the end!).
    5 Start a Docker container by running docker run -p 8000:8000 my-api.
    6 Once the container is running, you can access the API endpoints at http://localhost:8000/api/.

Once the development server is running, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like curl or a web browser.
###  That's it! You now have a local instance of the API running in a Docker container. You can use a tool like curl or a web browser to interact with the API endpoints.
